# Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction

This is the Tensorflow based implemention of Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion for recommender systems, forked from [Rianne van den Berg's implementation](https://github.com/riannevdberg/gc-mc), for prediction of drug-target interaction.
